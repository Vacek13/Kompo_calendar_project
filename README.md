# Calendar project
### An event storing calendar to organise your tasks.
This was a university project for Componential Programming course.

This tool allows you to add new events to your calendar and then export them to .csv or .xml format or save to a database.
You can also set custom notifications for each event to get a pop-up accompanied with alarm.

#### During development of this app we have learned a lot of important things such as:
* operating on events and event listeners
* handling exceptions
* cooperating with database using JDBC Driver
* handling Timers and TimerTasks
* creating simple graphical applications using Swing framework
* implementing serialization to given file formats
* handling usage of both graphical and console user interface in one application
* implementing custom shortcuts in application
